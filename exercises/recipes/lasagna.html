        <p>
            When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how
            successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up
            more
            than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two
            decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and legacy
            here.

                Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato
                paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt,
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>

                Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
