        <ul  id="ingredients">
            <li>
                2 medium russet potatoes, shredded
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ medium onion, finely chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup all-purpose flour
            </li>
            <li>
                1 egg
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup oil for frying, or as needed
            </li>
            <li>
                salt and pepper to taste
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="secondary-title">Steps</h2>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>
                Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
